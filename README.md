# Hypixel Skyblock Texture Pack Helper 

Note that all this does is make and write the .properties files for an already setup resource pack

### HOW TO USE:

1. Download and extract all files
2. Make sure you have you pack prepared (this includes having all images sorted into the right folders and subfolders)
    - All textures MUST be named after the skyblock item/block that they will be used on (use [neu repo](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO/tree/master/items) for the names to use if you aren't sure what to name them)<nobr>
    - A png file named 'pack.png' must be included for the pack cover
    - A '.mcmeta' file must be included for pack the description ([template](pack.mcmeta) provided)
        - You can use minecraft MOTD formatting codes in the description, which you can see [Here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/)
3. Run the python file
   1. Choose the correct folder
   2. Choose your name
   3. edit the creation settings
4. Done! Check the 'Output' folder for your finished pack

#### If any issues occur, dm `not_a_cow` on discord

### If you arent sure on how to organize the folder that you upload, you can reference how other skyblock resource packs have things sorted
or i guess asking me directly works too
