# Hypixel Skyblock Texture Pack Helper 

Note that all this does is make the .properties files for an already setup texture pack

### HOW TO USE:

1. Download and extract all files

2. Make sure you have you pack prepared (this includes having all images sorted into the right folders and subfolders)

    - All textures MUST be named after the skyblock item/block that they will be used on (use [neu repo](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO/tree/master/items) for the names to use if you arent sure what to name the images)

    - A png file named 'pack.png' must be included for the pack cover

    - A '.mcmeta' file must be included for pack descrption ([template](pack.mcmeta) provided)

        - You can use minecraft MOTD formatting codes in the description, which you can see [Here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/)

3. Done!
